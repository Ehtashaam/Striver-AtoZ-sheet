C++ STL is divided into 4 parts -
1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators


1.Pairs

-> It is a container which can hold/store 2 values.
-> If we want to store more than 2 values suppose 3,4,5 values then we can use nested Pairs
-> We can also declare an array of pair type
-> Pair lies inside the utility library

2.Vectors

-> Dynamic in nature
-> We can always increase the size of vectors whenever we wish to
-> Stores elements in a similar fashion as arrays
-> emplace_back is faster than push_back 
-> for erasing multiple elements we need to give the starting address and ending address+1
-> 

3. Iterators

-> begin() will point to the memory address and not the elements
-> end() will point to the memory address after the last element and not on the last element
-> auto automatically assigns datatype according to the datatype


4. List

-> push_front() is used to insert elements at the beginning. 
-> insert function in vectors is very costly.
